// Converged = Successfully found the root.

// if f(x) is a continuous function on the interval [a, b] and f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs (i.e., f(a)⋅f(b)<0), then there is 
// at least one root of the equation f(x)=0 in the interval (a,b).

// Guaranteed Convergence: It always converges to a root 
// if the function is continuous and f(a)⋅f(b) < 0.

// What happens if f(a)⋅f(b) ≥ 0 ?
// If f(a)⋅f(b) ≥ 0, the method cannot be applied because it indicates that either no root exists in the interval or there may be
//  multiple roots or the root might not be in the interval.

// How does the bisection method compare to other root-finding methods?
// The bisection method is slower compared to methods like Newton's method or secant method, but it is more robust and simple to implement, especially for 
// functions where derivatives are difficult to compute.
